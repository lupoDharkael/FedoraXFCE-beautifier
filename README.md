# FedoraXFCE-beautifier
Script designed to make your Fedora XFCE good looking and complete.

To run the script go to its folfer and execute this command in the terminal:

 `sudo -E bash xfce.sh $USER`
 
Requires restarting the system after the execution of the script due to problems with xfconf-query when executed with sudo
 

*Tested on fedora 25 (XFCE spin)*
